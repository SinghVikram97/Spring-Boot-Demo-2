[x] JPA Id's -> Make them into JPA "Entities"
[x] JPA Relationships -> Many to many relationship b/w authors and books

[x] Equals & Hash Code -> Implement equality based on id assigned by database
[x] To String

[x] Spring Data Repositories -> To interact with database, taking care of hibernate, transactional command, jdbc code provides abstraction

[x] Initialize some data to work with-> Command Line Runner, which Spring runs when it finds one

[x] Add Publisher Entity
[x] JPA Relationships- A Publisher can publish many books but a book will have only a single publisher, one to many

[x] h2 console enable- localhost:8080/h2-console and take jdbc url from console log which has Database available at 'jdbc:h2:mem:5f0e553c-519d-4092-bc38-7f3b44daa8a1'

[x] Spring MVC- Model View Controller
